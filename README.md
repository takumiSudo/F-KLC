## Scrapers

### Al Jazeera

The scraper for Al Jazeera can be found [here](scrapers/Aljazeerascraper.Rmd) under the [scrapers](scrapers) folder.

I scraped all articles in the [Israel-Palestine section of Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/tag/israel-palestine-conflict/) from after October 6th 12pm. I excluded the liveblogs, and articles that were in video or audio format. In total I scraped `1036` articles.

The scraped articles can be found [here](data/aljazeera_articles.csv) under [data](data) in csv format.
